# CountriesApp
A list of some countries which you can learn about them.

*VIPER Pattern
*API
*CoreData
*Not used SwiftUI.


The project mostly answers our requests but need some updates. You can list 10 countries from all over the world. If you did open the app at least one time, the countries are waiting for you otherwise function will call the list from API. 

We have two main pages, one for all countries and the other one is for saved country. From Countries page you can go to the detail of choosen country and find their flag and country code. Also you can visit WikiData page about the country. Really quick way of surfing. In detail page you can saved the country as your favourites just clicking star button.
In saved countries page, you can observe your favourite holiday points or you can delete them from  "Joanna's Favourite Holiday Route" list but don't worry. It will be waiting for you in lobby.




Enjoy it.
